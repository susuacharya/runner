REQUIREMENTS
	Following are the software requirements and directions on how to set them up:
		i. Python 3.2 or above – Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and look for downloads for Windows(or your operating system of choice) 
		ii. Pygame 2.x – Go to your default terminal (command prompt in my case) and type “pip install pygame” or “python-m pip install pygame”
	Alternatively, you can also download the files directly from the GitHub Repo at https://github.com/pygame/pygame. Follow the Readme there.

OBTAINING THE GAME FILES:
	The game files can be obtained from the following sources:
		i. GitHub: (preferably on a desktop) Go to *insert github repo link here* find the green ‘code’ button above the list of files. Click on it and select download.
			Download and extract the zip in your directory of choice.
		ii. Google Drive: Click on the link to download a zip file that can be extracted to your directory of choice : *insert drive link here*

HOW TO RUN:
	Simply double click on the main.py file to launch a terminal instance of the game. Alternatively, you could right click on the main.py and open with IDLE. Then run the script through the Run Toolbar.
	Once the game is up and running, you can use the Menu UI to further play.

CONTROLS:
	Most of the menus can be navigated using the mouse alone. The options menu also requires some keyboard input. Click on any menu to enter and click again to return to main menu.
	The game itself can be played using the W,S and D or up, left and right arrow keys.
	The Esc Key can be used mid game to pause and resume, and post game over to return to main menu.

NOTE:
Certain sprites might raise a “known incorrect sRGB format detected”  warning. It is just a warning and does not affect the game’s working, I’ve identified its source to png files edited using certain versions of Photoshop. Common fixes online including updating pygame to the latest version(which I have but doesn’t help)
